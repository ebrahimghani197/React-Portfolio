# Ebrahim Ghani's React Portfolio

Welcome to the source code repository of my professional React portfolio. This application showcases my journey as a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer, highlighting my projects, skills, and the experiences that have shaped my career.

## Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Here's how it works:

1. When you push changes to the main branch, GitHub automatically triggers the CI/CD workflow.
2. The workflow performs the following tasks:
    - Installs dependencies
    - Builds the project using `npm run build`
    - Deploys the built files to the `gh-pages` branch
    - Updates the GitHub Pages site with the new content

You don't need to manually run any deployment commands (i.e., `npm run build && npm run deploy`). Simply pushing changes to the main branch will automatically update your live site on GitHub Pages.

### Important Notes:

-   Never commit directly to the `gh-pages` branch. Always push changes to the main branch.
-   The site will be available at: https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name

    -   For me I'm hosting on a personal domain: https://temp

-   Make sure that you give GitHub Actions writing permissions, otherwise it won't be able to deploy the changes
